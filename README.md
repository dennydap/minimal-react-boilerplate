# Minimal React Boilerplate

Minimal React Boilerplate is a React Boilerplate without Create React App. It includes Bulma for the UI Framework. Please keep in mind that this is in development, but I think it's pretty ready for creating a simple site.

# How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennydap/minimal-react-boilerplate
cd minimal-react-boilerplate
npm install
npm start
```
